                                    <p>Our Special Executive Masters Certificates are Non-credit bearing and Non-Degree Certificates.</p>
                                    <p>These are not actual Masters Certificate but a trademark of the Metropolitan School of Business and Management. However, the modules of the Special Executive Masters Programme are modelled after the regular Masters programmes which allow delegates to gain a thorough knowledge of the subject. </p>
                                    <p>This programme cannot be used as a Masters Certificate or disguised as such as it carries no credit and cannot be used to pursue an academic PHD.</p>
                                    <p>However the relevancy of the certificate lies in the knowledge of the bearer to demonstrate ground knowledge of the subject the certificate was issued in, and this certificate counts towards the appropriate Continuous Professional Development (CPD).</p>
                                    <p>Our Special Executive Masters Certificates are awarded after the successful completion of the required Modules and Assessment.</p>
