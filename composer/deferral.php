                                        <p>Students may only defer their place on a course by up to 1 academic year (4 Sessions), subject to application, payment of a deferral/administrative fee and the School’s approval. Under no circumstances will deferral be granted for more than one academic year (4 Sessions). </p>
                                        <p>Students must make an application for deferral at least 28 days (4 weeks) before the Course Commencement Date.</p>
                                        <p>You can defer twice (2 Sessions) at no extra fee than the originally charged administrative fee plus any increase in Tuition Fee, but by the third deferment, there would be an increased administrative charge for the Session plus any increase in Tuition Fee and no more deferment after the fourth deferment. This means that failure to attend or take up the Course by the fourth deferment (1 academic year) would mean your initial Tuition Fee payment is forfeit.</p>
                                        <p>By the 5th deferment (next academic year), you would have to re-register, pay the registration fee and pay the Tuition Fee afresh.</p>
                                        <p>Applications Cancelled less than 4 weeks after initial payment are subject to an administration charge deductible from the initial payment made and/or as stated on your Invoice or payment page. </p>
                                        <p>No refund would be given for Cancellations less than 14 days to the Programme and there would be an administrative charge for deferment to another Session. </p>
                                        <p>Upon deferring their course, students waive their right to submit an application for a refund. Where a student has deferred their course, and subsequently fails or attempts to withdraw from the course NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED save in exceptional circumstances. The School has sole discretion in determining whether or not student’s circumstances are exceptional.</p>
