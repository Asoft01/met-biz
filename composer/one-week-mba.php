                                            As Business Strategy is the route to our goals and objectives, it belongs to and is the responsibility of every manager and decision-maker at all levels, be it corporate, strategic business unit or departmental. We must all then understand it, plan it and implement it. This module emphasises the importance of taking a wide view or 'helicopter vision' and provides analytical and decision-making techniques to look beyond everyday operational concerns and examine what the business as a whole has to do now and what it must do in the future. In this intensive module, a strategy is demystified through a mixture of casework and analysis of participants' own issues. This day will help you to develop your forward- thinking and give you the opportunity to explore the issues that are of prime concern to you.</p>

                                        <p>The Special Executive Masters Programme (SEMP) is an Executive Education Programme.It is "NON-CREDIT BEARING and NON-DEGREE HOLDING". The SEMP is NOT an actual Masters Programme but a trademark of the Metropolitan School of Business and Management. The SEMP is very similar to the "MINI MBA" offered by Universities all around the world. However, the modules of the SEMP programme was modelled after the regular masters programmes which allow delegates to gain a thorough knowledge of the subject. This programme cannot be used as a Masters Certificate or disguised as such as it carries no credit and cannot be used to pursue an academic PHD. However the relevance of the certificate lies in the knowledge of the bearer to demonstrate ground knowledge of the subject the certificate was issued in, and this certificate counts towards the appropriate Continuous Professional Development (CPD).</p>
