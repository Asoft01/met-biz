                                            <p>Personal Information: We will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. Unless you inform us otherwise: We will retain your personal information to contact you with marketing information and other school-related information that we would normally send to our alumni. We will ask you to complete anonymous evaluation surveys at the end of your Programme, the results of which we will circulate to relevant members in the School and externally for marketing purposes only unless you write to us to tell us otherwise. We will use video and photographic images of your Programme for promotional campaigns and engage with the wider community. </p>
                                            <p>Enforcement and Termination: We will terminate your contract and registration with us if we consider you to be in breach of any of these terms and condition, which includes you not complying with other relevant rules, regulations and academic requirements, including those listed above. Any waiver of, or failure to enforce the terms or conditions of this Contract will not mean a continual waiver or prevent enforcement in future. The terms of the Contract shall not be enforceable by any party who is not a party to it. </p>
                                            <p>The Contract and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
